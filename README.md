> Cypress preprocessor for bundling JavaScript via rollup

## Installation

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/cypress-rollup-preprocessor.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/cypress-rollup-preprocessor/)

First install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). Then:

```sh
npm install cypress-rollup-preprocessor --save-dev
```

This package relies on the following [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies):

- rollup

It is likely you already have these installed either directly or as a transient
dependency, but if not, you will need to install them.

```sh
npm install --save-dev rollup
```

## Compatibility

This version is only compatible with rollup 2.x+

## Usage

In your project's [plugins file](https://on.cypress.io/guides/tooling/plugins-guide.html):

```javascript
const rollupPreprocessor = require("cypress-rollup-preprocessor");

module.exports = (on) => {
  on("file:preprocessor", rollupPreprocessor());
};
```

### Examples

- [Basic](https://github.com/lmarqs/cypress-rollup-preprocessor/tree/master/examples/basic)
- [Using Typescript](https://github.com/lmarqs/cypress-rollup-preprocessor/tree/master/examples/typescript)

## Options

Pass in options as the argument to `rollup`:

```javascript
const rollupPreprocessor = require("cypress-rollup-preprocessor");

// Using the options from rollup.config.js
const rollupConfig = require("../../rollup.config");

module.exports = (on) => {
  const options = {
    inputOptions: rollupConfig,
    outputOptions: rollupConfig.output,
  };

  on("file:preprocessor", rollupPreprocessor(options));
};
```

### inputOptions

Object of rollup input options. You can just `require` in the options from your
`rollup.config.js` to use the same options as your app.
